 - Reaction squad system to ping people to react to a mention
 - Auto create tweets for events on Mozilla Reps for a given query
 - Tweet pinning management

## Set up a repo for use with this tool

### Requirements
 - GitHub user auth token (will use that to create issues and comment on them etc.)
    - Needs the repo:write scope
 - Twitter API credentials incl. OAuth tokens and secret (will tweet to this account)
 - Node >= 7.7.1

### Issue template
An issue template is generated in the repository if none is found. See the documentation for GitHub issue templates.

### Configuration
The configuration is defined with JSON in the file `config.json` in the root directory of the project. It is validated against the [config schema](templates/config.schema.json). The default config can be found in [`config.default.json`](config.default.json). Note that this is not a working config, as invalid values are provided for the authentication credentials for Twitter and GitHub.

#### Basic anatomy
The configuration consists of an array of repositories to run the tool on. Each repository has its entirely separate configuration.

#### Required properties
##### githubToken
Token to the GitHub account the service should run as.

##### repo
Repository the tool should run on. Should be of the form of "username/repository".

##### twitter
Object with four properties:
 - `consumer_key`: Twitter API consumer key as string
 - `consumer_secret`: Twitter API consumer secret as string
 - `access_token_key`: Twitter API access token (you may have to generate this)
 - `access_token_secret`: Twitter API access token secret (you may have to generate this)

##### projectName
Name of the GitHub project board to run the tool in.

#### Additional properties

##### sources
Sources to run on the board. You need to declare these, else none are loaded. The sources are a key on an object, where their value currently is just an empty object, but will eventually hold source configuration.

There are currently three stable sources:
 - **issues**: Adds open issues to the Ideas column.
 - **mentions**: Opens issues for new mentions on Twitter.
 - **tweeting**: Tweets valid issues from the To tweet column and moves them to tweeted and closes them.

##### columns
Adjust the names of the columns the tool uses. Built in column identifiers:
 - `ideas`
 - `reactions`
 - `events`
 - `toTweet`
 - `tweeted`

(To be deprecated and moved to sources)

##### labels
Adjust the names of the labels the tool uses. Built in label identifiers:
 - `retweet`
 - `ready`
 - `invalid`

##### schedulingTime
Define the local time zone and the date format for scheduling Tweets. An object with two properties.

###### format
Date format for scheduling tweets.

**Placeholders**:
 - `YYYY`: Four digit representation of the year
 - `MM`: Two digit representation of the month
 - `DD`: Two digit representation of the day of the month
 - `HH`: Two digit 24 hours representation of the hour
 - `mm`: Two digit representation of the minute in the hour

**Dividers**:
 - `.`
 - `:`
 - ` `
 - `T`
 - `Z`
 - `-`

###### timezone
Integer offset from UTC of the machine the tool is running on.

#### Example
```json
[
    {
        "githubToken": "",
        "repo": "mozillach/twitter",
        "projectName": "Tweets",

            "retweet": "Retweet",
            "ready": "ready",
            "invalid": "invalid"
        },
        "schedulingTime": {
            "format": "DD.MM.YYYY HH:mm",
            "timezone": 1
        },
        "twitter": {
            "consumer_key": "",
            "consumer_secret": "",
            "access_token_key": "",
            "access_token_secret": ""
        },
        "sources": {
            "issues": {
                "columns": ["Ideas"]

                ]
            }
        }
    }
]
```
